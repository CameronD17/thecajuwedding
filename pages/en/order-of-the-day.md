# Timeline

## Friday, September 20th 2024 - CaJu Wedding Warm-up

![Friday timeline]({{site.url}}/assets/img/friday_timeline.png)

We'll be on-site from 4pm onwards, and we will have a pizza truck with us (courtesy of [Bangin' Pizza](https://www.banginpizza.co.uk/)) from about 7-9pm. It will be an informal night, where we want to spend time with as many of you as we can, as we know weddings can sometimes be difficult for that. BYOB, no dress code, just pizza and beer and music and good company (you guys need to bring that last part because we certainly aren't).

## Saturday, September 21st 2024 - The Big Day

![Saturday timeline]({{site.url}}/assets/img/saturday_timeline.png)

If Aberfeldy finally has a parkrun, then we'll be off doing that in the morning. Please join us if you are able to! We are planning to be back at Boreland for about 10:30. If you're coming from afar on the day, please arrive by 12:30!

# Drinks

Friday is _exclusively_ BYOB! The bar won't be open for us, so please bring your own! The nearest supermarkets are in Killin or Aberfeldy, both about a 20-25 minute drive from Boreland.

On Saturday, there will be a cash bar serving the usual beers/wines/spirits. Plus a bonus for everyone on the tables (this will make more sense on the day).

# Wedding Breakfast Menu

*NOTE:* this menu is provisional and subject to change - we will be finalising it soon and asking for menu choices and dietary requirements as part of your RSVP, but as an example of what we will have:

## Starters

- Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato Soup served with Herb Oil & Croutons (Vegan & GF)
- Hot Smoked Salmon Nicoise Salad (GF)

## Mains

*(All served with skin on rosemary roast new potatoes & seasonal vegetables)*
- Traditional Scottish Roast Beef with Homemade Yorkshire Pudding and Beef Jus
- Chicken Ballottines with Sage and Pancetta, served with a Pan Jus (GF)
- Char Grilled Vegetable, Sweet Potato and Chickpea Tian with Roasted Tomato and Basil Sauce (Vegan & GF)

## Desserts

- Crème Brulee Topped with Raspberries, handmade shortbread (V)
- Sticky Toffee Pudding with Butterscotch Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream (Vegan & GF)

# Dress Code

Formal / national dress please! No T-Rex costumes this time (Júlia made me write that, wear a T-Rex costume if you want!)

# Gifts

We have zero expectation for gifts. Y'all are coming a long way just to see us and your presence is present enough.

That said (and only for those that insist), we would appreciate donations to [the Edinburgh Dog & Cat Home](https://edch.org.uk/donate/), or for those that prefer, we won't turn down anyone chipping in for our long-dreamed-of-Mamma-Mia-style Greek honeymoon (ask us for details, or we will share a link nearer the day). Either (or neither) option would make us very happy!
