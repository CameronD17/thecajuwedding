# About Boreland

> Once a working farm, we now offer self-catering stays and big bold venue spaces. All situated across 117 acres with spectacular views.
> Of course, much of our land is still used for farming. You’ll see sheep, cattle, and our resident horses all nearby.

Boreland is on the northern banks of Loch Tay, the sixth-largest loch in Scotland, and close by to several munros, including Ben Lawers (10th highest mountain in the UK), and Schiehallion, the approximate centre of Scotland. Júlia has forbidden me from climbing any mountains before the wedding, although she said nothing about wild swimming in the loch, so if anyone wants to bring a wetsuit, you can join me before the ceremony...

# Accommodation

For those coming from far (far) away, don't worry, we have sorted accommodation for you on-site for the full weekend Friday (from 4pm) to Sunday (kick out at 10am). We would _love_ to have everyone there for the full weekend if possible, but there just aren't enough beds for the number of guests.

If we can't sort you to stay on-site, we have found these hotels nearby:

- [Fortingall Hotel](https://www.fortingall.com/) (Fortingall, 2.5 miles)
- [The Kenmore Club](https://www.kenmoreclub.com/)(Kenmore, 3.8 miles)
- [Taymouth Marina](https://www.taymouthmarina.com/) (Kenmore, 4.6 miles)
- [The Breadalbane Arms](https://www.inspiredhotels.co.uk/breadalbane-arms-hotel) (Aberfeldy, 10.2 miles)

There are also a fair few self-catering cottages / AirBnBs nearby, including in Fearnan itself (which would be walking distance from Boreland).

Boreland is approximately a two-hour drive north from both Edinburgh and Glasgow. Public transport is sparse in this part of the Highlands, so we will be organising as much transport as possible for those coming from far away, and if you have spare seats and are able to car-share with other guests that would be much appreciated! We will facilitate organising this closer to the time.

If you do prefer public transport, then the nearest train stations to Boreland are [Crianlarich](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crianlarich/@56.3904696,-4.6210261,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4888e186b8475db5:0xb095bb83640b1c4f!8m2!3d56.3904667!4d-4.6184512!16zL20vMGJydGo0?entry=ttu) on the West Highland Line (from Glasgow), or [Dunkeld & Birnam](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dunkeld+%26+Birnam/@56.5569701,-3.5807665,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4886191f97b29139:0x2ba597e311c64e46!8m2!3d56.5569672!4d-3.5781916!16zL20vMGJ5eGx0?entry=ttu) on the Highland Main Line (from Edinburgh or Perth). Both are approximately 45 minutes drive from Boreland, and onward connections via bus will take several hours (and involve a lot of waiting around!), so as much as we try to be environmentalists, we do not recommend taking public transport to get here without organising a collection at the other end!
